Remaking my Scratch 1.4 project in Unity

Smokebound is a game I created as the final project for my Grade 10 Computer Studies class. It is a short RPG with simple turn-based combat. Now recreated in Unity2D with smoother mechanics and better UI.

Excerpts from my original design process:

> ### The Story
>
> Smokebound is a turn-based RPG where you play as a boy named “Marcus”. Upon starting the game, you hear a strange voice that tasks you with defeating a being named “The Prince of Smoke”. This voice grants you the power of thunder and lightning. Your objective is to find the 4 keys scattered around the world that represent each area (AquaKey, IceKey, GrassKey, RocKey). These keys will allow you to unlock the monument in the center of the world.
>
> ### The Level
>
> Using resources from RPG Maker MV, I created 9 areas that the player would be able to travel around.
>
> \*An early concept of gameplay heavily inspired by RPG Maker's side battle system. The writing says:
>
> - "moving to end of screen switches background"
> - "top view, side view during battle"
>
> \*An outline of which areas are safe and which have random enemy encounters. This directly corresponds with the image below.
>
> \*A stitched version of the world. Obstacles are purely aesthetic and have no collision with the player character. Each safe space has an inn where the player can restore their HP.
>
> \*Creating the main town in RPG Maker
>
> ### The Sprites
>
> \*Using the character generator in RPG Maker MV, I created Marcus, the main character that was explained earlier. Only a few of the battle sprites are used.
>
> ### The Gameplay
>
> \*You only need to use the arrow keys and the 'Z' key to play Smokebound (as well as Scratch 1.4)
>
> I created the battle UI in paint.net.
>
> I do not own any music or sound effects as they belong to their respective creators.
