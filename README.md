Remaking my Scratch 1.4 project in Unity

WIP, but you can find the original design/thought process I had in 2018 on my [older website](https://mercadobrendan7.wixsite.com/portfolio/ics-202-smokebound).

At the bottom of the page, there is also a link to the original Scratch 1.4 `.sb` file that I submitted.[^1] 

[^1]: Original game does not run properly anymore, but feel free to look at the source code
